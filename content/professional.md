I have been a _Web Developer_ for (new Date().getFullYear() - 2011) = 10
years now and have worked on projects small and large, in studios small and
large.

Primarily working as a _front end developer_ using Javascript and specialising in _React_, I also have non trivial experience in working with databases, server infrastructure, back end technologies and even further more creative outlets such as Physical Computing, Creating Coding and Graphic Design.
