Got a lot more data, and also updated the visual. The thing to look at from a glance is 'blue' is where bikes are not, 'red' is where they are. So you can start to see how people live on the outskirts of the city and come into the city in the day.

That is because you can see its red around the outside at night, and turns blue around the outside in the day (full docks -> empty docks).

Also interestingly my data spans over the 12th april, when shops etc. were able to open after lockdown measures, so you can see that post the 12th april it becomes a lot more exaggerated, especially the 17th april which is the first saturday since measures changed.

Data is cool!
