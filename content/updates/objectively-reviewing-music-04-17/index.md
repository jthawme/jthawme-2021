D﻿uring lockdown I decided I'd review every CD I own.

I﻿ got absolutely nowhere near through them. I did them alternate alphabetical so I'd not get bias from going through an artist's discography, cut it up a bit, but it was still too much.

W﻿hat I wasn't expecting, is that apparently Flower Boy by Tyler the Creator is 1 better than Enema of the State by Blink 182. I'm as surprised as everyone else!
