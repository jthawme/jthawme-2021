I redid the mechanism that I used for [Drum Generates](/project/drum-generates/) to be a bit more flexible and certainly more reliable. It now uses RGB LED strips so it has access to a much larger colour spectrum too and is controlled via midi through my laptop, so live or programmable is the same to it.
