I have said goodbye to my previous site, and if I'm honest a tear will be shed for it. But it was time.

This new format is aiming to free the shackles of dependence from other platforms, namely twitter, and to carve out my own. I wanted to get rid of this idea about worrying what to post, having consistency or even sometimes formed ideas. No one was asking this of me, but it was the pressure of the platform for me.

Anyway, below and soon above, is stuff I am building, trying out and enjoying making (hopefully). If you are interested sign up to the newsletter, it'll be a small email every month or so, with just links to recent things I've liked.
