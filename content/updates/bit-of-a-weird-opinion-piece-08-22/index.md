Seeing this as a trending thing (and reading the story about it) I find it that weird thing again where its angled that we should feel sympathy for something. Starting a bit of text like that will always make me insane, BUT my angle is not a 'told you so' or anything like that, but I think it's a very interesting look into the larger problem with the web and possibly beyond.

If you rely on a platform that is not your own, then that can get pulled out from under you at any point. I feel sorry individually for people who rely on it, but the mass as a whole I feel like they were always living with this as a possibility and it just happened.
