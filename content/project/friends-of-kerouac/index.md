      Leveraging newer technologies and libraries allowed the project to have a
      design that I felt honoured the spontaneity of Kerouac, while also playing
      homage to the format of books in which his work was laid.


      Using gatsby allowed this content heavy site to run smoothly and also utilising CSS grid and custom properties gave me more flexibity to play with more print like layouts than ever before.

The site acts as a visual compendium to the characters and subsequent people that made up the Beat Generation in Kerouac's books and in real life.

It removes the facade of the psuedonym's for each individual book while also acting as a tool to piece together Kerouac's group of friends over the years of his works.
