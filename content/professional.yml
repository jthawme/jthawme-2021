  I have been a \_Web Developer\_ for (new Date().getFullYear() - 2011) = 10
  years now and have worked on projects small and large, in studios small and
  large.


  Primarily working as a \_front end developer\_ using Javascript and specialising in \_React\_, I also have non trivial experience in working with databases, server infrastructure, back end technologies and even further more creative outlets such as Physical Computing, Creating Coding and Graphic Design.
